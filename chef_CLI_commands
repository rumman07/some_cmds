/**Key Concepts:
*Recipes are made up of a collection of resources 
*Cookbooks are made up of a collection of recipes 
*Nodes receive their policy based off of roles and individual node configurations
*A run list defines the order in which you want your recipes to run during convergence 
*Configuration drift occurs when the desired state of the node does not match the desired state as defined in the policies on the chef server 
*Configuration drift can be resolved by automating/running the chef-client agent 
*

###To install chefdk on OSX and Linux run the following command: 
$curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash   #walgreens 
$curl -s https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P chefdk  #linuxacademy 
###Setup shell environemnt in ~/.bash_profile so that default ruby interpreter is the chef embeded ruby interpreter not the system ruby interpreter
$echo 'eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile 
$source ~/.bash_profile 
$which chef 
$which ruby 
###Quick sanity check to make sure chef was installed and configured correctly 
$chef -v 
###Intalling and configuring some packages for chef workstation 
$yum install -y git yum-utils
#Configure git 
$git config --global user.name "Rumman Ahmed"
$git config --global user.email "rummanahmed.**@gmail.com"
$git config --global core.editor vim 
$git config --global color.ui auto 
###Install and configure docker 
$yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo  #Invoking yum config manage to add a repo
$yum makecache fast 
$yum install -y docker-ce 
$systemctl enable docker 
$systemctl start docker 
$usermod -aG docker $USER 
###Disbale services to not run systemd inside of a container 
$systemctl stop getty@tty1.service 
$systemctl mask getty@tty1.service 
#In order to complete the configuration log out and log back in 
###Configure docker 
$docker network create --subnet=10.1.1.0/24 testnet  #create a network for docker 
$gem install kitchen-docker  
*Versionable - Testable - Repeatable - Collaborative
*
*A resource statement defines the desired state of the configuration, a resource maps to a "provider" which defines the steps to achieve that desired 
*state of configuration. When you write your code, you use resources to describe your infrastructure. A resource corresponds to some piece of 
*infrastructure, such as a file, a template, or a package
*An application cookbook typically contains multiple recipes, where each recipe configures one part of the system. The default recipe, default.rb, lists these recipes in 
*the order needed to build your application or service
*A Chef recipe is a file that groups related resources, such as everything needed to configure a web server, database server, or a load balancer
*A Chef cookbook provides structure to your recipes and, in general, helps you stay organized. The Chef DK includes other command line tools for 
*interacting with Chef. These include knife for interacting with the Chef server, and chef for interacting with your local chef code repository (chef-repo)
*
*Once you’re done developing and testing code on your local workstation, you can upload it to the Chef server. The Chef server acts as a hub for 
*configuration data. It stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to the systems in your infrastructure and metadata that describes each system 
*The knife command lets you communicate with the Chef server from your workstation
*
*An attribute is the specific detail about the node. An Attribute allows us to define information about something 
*Attribute levels of precedence : Attribute file; Node/recipe; Environment; role 
*default : Automatically reset at the start of every chef client run is the lowest level of precedence; 
*force_default : Used in a cookbook or recipe to override an existing "default" attribute; 
*normal : A setting that persists in the node object; 
*override : Automatically reset at the start of every chef client most often should be used only when required;
*force_override : used to ensure that an attribute defined in a cookbook (by an attribute file or by a recipe) takes precendence over an override attribute set by a role or an environment;
*automatic : Contains data populated by ohai at the begining of every chef-client run and cannot be modified and always has the highest attribute precendence; 
*
*In Chef code, you'll often see the ::File notation. The colon :: notation specifies use of the core Ruby File class
*The Chef::Resource::File class also exists to implement the file resource
*
*A wrapper cookbook extends or changes the behavior of a cookbook without forking it 
*
*The <%= %> notation indicates placeholders that are replaced when Chef applies the template
*<% if @port == 80 -%>  # - means suppress the line break after the ruby evaluation
*
*Because Chef loads dependent cookbooks first, the values specified in the current cookbook's attributes file will overwrite any existing attribute values
*Ohai is used to detect attributes on a node and report them to chef client at the start of every chef client run as well as at the end of every
*chef client run. It is required for the chef client to run because it builds the node object 
*Chef client is an agent that runs locally on every single nodes that is registered with the chef server 
*Policy is a collection of system configurations that you define ex: roles, data bags, environments. The policy states the state that 
*each resources should be in but not how to get there. Chef-client will pull the policy and configure the node so that it matches the state of the policy 
*
* Resources: Defines the desired state for a single configuration item present on a node that is under management by chef. Does the 
*configuration on a node and maps to providers. Resources represent a piece of the system and its desired state
*When chef client is run on a node the resource is executed by the provider which is handled by chef and the OS itself  
*
*Node object is made up of the run lists which define what recipes to run during a chef-client as well as the attributes that define information about the node 
*Chef search allows queries to be made for any type of data that is indexed by the chef server. Search queries the chef server for stored information 
*A data bag is a global variable that is stored in JSON data and accessible from the chef server. A data bag is indexed for searching and can be loaded by a recipe or access during search 
*An environment is a way to map an organizations real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed using the chef server
*
*The primary testing tools you’ll use are Cookstyle, Foodcritic, ChefSpec, InSpec, and Test Kitchen. With them, you can make sure your Chef code does 
*what you intended before you deploy it to environments used by others, such as staging or production
*
*Chef Automate gives you a full-stack continuous deployment pipeline, automated testing for compliance and security, as well as visibility into 
*everything that’s happening as you move your applications and infrastructure through the pipeline and then when they’re in production

**********Running Test Kitchen********************************************************************
=begin 
*Test kitchen provides an automated testing framework for your cookbooks across different platforms
*and offers a driver plugin architecture to ensure your code can be tested on as many platforms 
*as you need. Test suites help you extend and differentiate your tests allowing for complex 
*combination of tests to occur.
*Configuration for test kitchen is defined in a .kitchen.yml file which is YAML formatted 
*The .kitchen.yml file contains specific syntax to configure the requirements for handling your 
*test cases: 
*Drivers are used to create the platform instances which are used during cookbook testing
driver: 
     name: driver_name 
*provisioner: Provisioner specify how the chef-client will be simulated during the testing process
*the most commmon configurations are chef-zero and chef-solo. Key functionality of the chef_zero
*and chef_solo provisioner is the ability to use the require_chef_omnibus setting to install a
*specific chef version
provisioner:
     name: provisioner_name   #it can be name: chef_zero || name: chef_solo
	 require_chef_omnibus: 12.8.1
*Shell provisioner
provisioner:
    name: shell
*The verifier configuration defines which test framwork will perform tests	 
verifier:   
   name: inspec 
*Transport defines the communication protocol for the execution of remote commands. Among other 
*things, transport settings can include things like username, password, connection retries or port 
transport:
   name: transport_name    #it can be name: ssh || name: winrm 
*Platforms defines chef server attributes that are common to the collection of test suites
*The platform_version defines the list of operating system and version on which kitchen will 
*perform cookbook testing  
platform: 
   name: platform_version
*Suites is a list of a group of tests which allow the granular combinations of run_lists and platforms
*to define what is being tested

*********************************Deleting node from the chef server**********************************************
#Bootstrapping a node not only installs Chef on that node, but creates a client object on the Chef server as well. Running the Chef client on your node 
#uses the client object to authenticate itself against the Chef server on each run. Additionally, to registering a client, a node object is created on 
#the Chef server. The node object is the main data structure, which you can use to query node data inside your recipes

#Step1: Delete the node object: 
$knife node delete --yes node_name 

#Step2: Delete the client object: 
$knife client delete --yes my_node 
	
	
$yum remove chef -y
