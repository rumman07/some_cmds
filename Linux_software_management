*When the system boots, typically one process called the init process starts up the /sbin/init that in turn manages child processes 
*Memory leak: when the coding of a program request memory from the kernel and then fails to return that memory when it finished using it
*
*
*$command FLAGS/OPTIONS/SUBCOMMANDS/ARGUMENTS  # Basic structure of commands
*command: "what to do?"; options: "How to do it?"; arguments" "What to do with it"
*
*#Flags start with a single dash and are followed by a single letter. For example, if you want to view the contents of a directory in long format you can use ls -l. 
*#The longer form starts with two dashes and is then followed by an entire word. For example, "chef --help" Flags are almost always optional and can be specified in any order
*
*#Options are like flags but require a value to follow them. An example is the user name or password you provide when you bootstrap a Chef node with the knife command, 
*#"knife bootstrap ipaddress --user USERNAME --ssh-password PASSWORD" Options are almost always optional and can be specified in any order
*
*#Some commands require additional commands, called subcommands, that refine the focus of the original command. One example is "git status" which uses the git command and the status 
*#subcommand to ask for status. Commands may require multiple subcommands to increasingly refine their scope. These subcommands must be provided in a specific order
*
*#Some commands may allow for optional arguments or require them to be specified. An example is the ls command. When a valid path is provided as an argument, such as ls ~, 
*#the files within that directory are displayed. These arguments are often required and must be provided in a specific order
*
*Linux command parameters can be divided into two types: Parameters with a "-" are called options AND Parameters with no leading dash are called arguments
*
*
*The yum command line utility is a package management program for those linux distributions that uses the RPM packages
*The basics of run level
*0-halt (do not set initdefault to this); 1-Single user mode; 2-Multiuser, without NFS(The same as 3, if you do not have networking); 3-Full multiuser mode
*4-unused or admin; 5-The default run level if you have a graphical user interface on your Centos server; 6-reboot(do not set initdefault to this)
*Editing the /etc/inittab to change default runlevel (id:5:initdefault:<br />
*The Mount directory is where you typically going to store your directories that you want to use as mount points for your filesystems

***************All about the MAN Command************************************'
##The MAN page has 9 sections: 1)Executable programs and shell commands 2)System calls provided by the kernel 3)Library calls provided by the program library 
##4)Device file (usually stored in /dev) 5)File formats 6)Games 7)Miscelaaneous(macro packages, conventions, and so on) 8)System administration commands (req root previleges)
##9)kernel routines
##You can switch between the section by simple passing the section  number like so: 
$man 5 <cmdName>
$whatis <cmdNAme>
###MAN pages are organized like so: Name; Synopsis; Description; Options; Files; See Also; Bugs; History; Author
$man -k <cmdName>  #searches for anything that has the cmdName mentioned in the documentation 
$apropos <cmdName>  #searches for and displays cmdName mentioned in the documentation 
$info info   #The new manpage
$rpm -ql yum | grep README
$find /usr/share/doc -name "*passwd*"
$locate <cmdName>
$whereis <cmdName>


###Utilities to read different file formats:
#File extensions .1-.9 - man, info, less 
#File extensions .gz or .bx2 - use gunzip, bunzip2 to extract the files first then read with; less
#File extensions .txt - less and any text edit vi, vim
#FIle extension .html or .htm - any web browser
#File extension .odt - Libre office, OpenOffice.org, any word processor app 
#File extension .pdf - xpdf, AdobeReader 
#File extension .tif, .png, .jpg - Gimp

*****************The Linux Filesystem*******************************************
/**
*Where the data is stored on a storage device within a certain manner: data is organized and easily located; Data can be saved in a persistent manner; Data integrity is preserved; Data can be quickly retrieved for a user in a later point in time 
*The linux file system uses a FileSystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) hierarchy structure to organize data  
*Linux systems have a standard in which at the root directory has several of the same sub directories in a certain order or fashion 
*FHS keeps all the linux distributions in line so end user can know where certain types of data is stored within the linux file systems 
*/dev stores two types of device files: Character oriented device file sends or receive data sequentially one character at a time ex: printer, mice other sorts of peripheral devices
*the second sort of device stored within the /dev folder is the block oriented device files. These are files that manage data what is known as blocks ex: actual hard drive, usb, etc. Block devices supports random access to data stored on them  
*Physical hardware on any linux system is addressed by application and services running on the system through actual files that live in the /dev folder
*/etc folder contains text based configuration files used by the system as well as services running in the system
*/etc/aliases  #Contains a table used to redirect all to local users 
*/etc/exports  #Configured file systems to be exported to remove NFS clients 
*/etc/fstab    #lists the partitions and file systems that will be automatically mounted when we boot our linux system

**************************Standard bash file Descriptor**********************************************************************
There are three file descriptors 
stdin(0)  #standard input
stdout(1) #standard output 
stderr(2) #standard error

*********************************Tape Archive (TAR)**************************************************************************
#`tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive, and can restore individual files from the archive
#A linux utility that archive things. It does not compress or compact files. It sticks all your files together into one file 
$tar -cf archive.tar foo bar  # Create archive.tar from files foo and bar
$tar -tvf archive.tar   # List all files in archive.tar verbosely
$tar -xf archive.tar    # Extract all files from archive.tar
# -C, --directory=DIR        change to directory DIR
$sudo tar -xvf apache-tomcat-8*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1
#for the tar command the order of the flags -xvf matters you cannot put f in the begining
#We can also call on the compression algorithm types when using the tar utility with option flags
#tar -zcf (gzip)  will produce file.tar.gz or file.tgz in one pass the extensions are synonimous just different naming convention 
#tar -jcf (bzip2) will produce file.tar.bz2 or file.tb2 in one pass the extensions are synonimous just different naming convention
$tar -zcf nameoffolder.tgz foldername 
$tar -zxvf nameoffolder.tar.gz  #to uncompress and unarchive in one pass

tar -zcvf /var/preserve/<dir_name>-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).tar.gz <dir_name_to_backup>  #creating a backup of a directory with timestamp 

###Compression tools: Gzip, Bzip2, Zip
$gzip nameoffolder.tar   #to compress a file
$gunzip nameoffolfer.tar.gz  #to uncompress a file
 
###Bzip2 does a better job than Gzip in compressing a file since it has a better algorithm of compressing a file than gzip
$yum install -y bzip2  #To install bzip2 
$bzip2 nameoffolder.tar  #to compress a file 
$bunzip2 nameoffolder.tar.bz2 #to uncompress a file 

###Zip is the only tool that can archive and compress at once most commonly used in the Windows operating system 
$yum install -y zip  $To install zip 
$zip <nameofzip.zip> filename.txt   #to compress a file 
$zip -r nameoffolder.zip foldertozip  #-r stands for recursive which recursively zips all the content of the folder 
$yum install -y unzip  #To install unzip 
$unzip <nameofzip.zip> #to uncompress a file 
$unzip -r nameoffolder.zip  #-r recursively unzip 
$unzip -l nameoffolder.zip  #list the content of the archive folder

************************************Sudoers file***********************************************************
##Sudoers allows particular users to run various commands as the root user, without needing the root password
##By default the sudoers file is configured in Centos7 to allow all members all users who are members of the wheel group to use sudo to do anything that root can do
##Wheel group allows people in group wheel to run all commands
##Sudoers file could specify individual users can run what software on which machines 
##(the sudoers file can be shared between multiple systems) but by default centos has is it set up to where you simply just add a user to the wheel group and you're all set
$sudo visudo #to edit the /etc/sudoers file

$finger  #Shows infromation on user account within the linux filesystem
$yum install -y finger 
$pwck   #to verify /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow are in sync 
$pwconv #adds missing users from /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow
$w  #The w command shows information about users currently on the machine and their processes 
$who

$who -a   #shows all the information at once 
$last <user>     #to see what the linux user last activity was 

#User IDs
###To find a user’s UID (user ID) or GID (group ID) and other information in Linux/Unix-like operating systems, use the id command
#The syntax is: id [options] [UserNameHere]
$id -u -g -G <userName>   # -u is uid -g is group id -G is associated group id
$id -nu -ng -nG  <username> #the -n option displays names instead of id numbers 
##You can show the real ID for the -g, -G and -u options instead of the effective ID by passing the -r option
$id -r -u <username>  #use the -r option to query the real id instead of the effective id 
$id -r -u <username>

###Useradd 
$vi /etc/default/useradd   #The location of default settings of the useradd utility
$useradd -D   #Prints out the user default configurations 
#/etc/login.defs  #This file contains default values for /etc/shadow and /etc/default/useradd

**************************Virtualization QEMU-KVM***************************************************
/**
*Virtualization is really taking something that is actual and virtualizing it. There are different kinds of virtualizations: Hardware virtualization, Partial virtualization and Para Virtualization
*Full Virtulaization: Complete simulation of the actual hardware to allow software, which typically consists of a guest machine or virtual machine. KVM uses full virtualization
*Para-virtualizatio: The hardware env is not simulated Advantage its faster then Full virtualization. Disadvantage The guest operating system i actually gonna require special device drivers
*VMM/Hypervisor is a piece of software that is responsible for monitoring and controlling virtual machines or guest operating system : Type 1 Hypervisor; the hypervisor runs 
*directly on top of the hardware : Type 2 Hypervisor; the hypervisor acts as a seperate layer often on top of a base Operating System. Type 2 hypervisor are also known as hosted hypervisor 
*Type 2 Hypervisor are dependent on the host operating system for every operations that takes place. The main advantage of type 2 hypervisor is the wide range of hardware support
*because the uderlying host operating system is controlling all of the hardware access. The KVM Hypervisor supports over commiting of system resources 
*Overcommitting is to allocate more virtualized CPUs or virtual memory than the available resources on the host system provides 
*Thin Provisioning allows you to optimize available storage space for the guest virtual machines. Similar to over committing but only pertains to storage not CPU and memory
