###VNet is a representation of a on-prem solution in the cloud, its a logical isolation of azure cloud dedicated to a subscription. You can have as many VNet as you like
#per resource group but you will have the the limitiation how many subnets you can have in a VNet based on the schema of the VNet 
#Subnet is a range of ipaddresses in a VNet that you can divide VNet into multiple subnets 
###Azure VPN Gateways: Used to send network traffic between virtual networks and on-premises locations
#Gateway subnet: First a gateway named GatewaySubnet must be created 
#Gateway Types: VPN, ExpressRoute  
#VPN Types: 
#Policy based VPN: Encrypt and direct packets through IPsec tunnels
#Route-based VPN: Use routes in the IP forwarding or routing table to direct packets into their corresponding tunnel interfaces 
#The tunnel interfaces then encrypt or decrypt the packets in and out of the tunnels
#Azure VPN Gateways Connetion types: IPsec, Vnet2Vnet, ExpressRoute, VPNClient
#Local network gateways: The on-premises location of the VPN tunnel in which you will give the local network gatways a name, the 
#public IP address of the on-premises VPN device, and specify the address prefixes that are located on the on-prem location
